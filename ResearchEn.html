<p>
I am interested in regularity of the motion of a surface by its mean
curvature. To show the existence of the surface, we frequently
consider the various weak type solution. I mainly study the regularity
of these weak solutions, in other word, the weak solution is actual
solution or not. Considering the embedding to the Euclid space, the
moving surface obeys some nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation. I
also study regularity theory for nonlinear partial differential
equations, especially degenereta parabolic type.
</p>

As my interest, I like not only differential equations but also
differential geometry. Actually I study the surface and the curve from
the point of partial differential equations, geometrical measure
theory. Nowadays, I am interested in mathematical modeling for the
evolution of grain boundaries, which is related to the motion of a
surface. And I study the mathematical properties of the model.
